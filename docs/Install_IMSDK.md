# Install IM SDK (Intelligent Multimedia SDK)

The Intelligent Multimedia SDK (IM SDK) is a comprehensive software development kit provided by Qualcomm for their IoT and edge computing platforms. It enables developers to leverage hardware-accelerated multimedia processing, sensor integration, and AI capabilities on Qualcomm-based devices like the Rubik Pi.

## What is the IM SDK?

The IM SDK includes:
- **GStreamer plugins** for hardware-accelerated video encoding/decoding
- **Sensor test applications** for validating device sensors
- **Sample applications** demonstrating multimedia capabilities
- **Development tools** for building custom multimedia applications
- **Libraries** for accessing Qualcomm's specialized hardware features

## Prerequisites

Before installing the IM SDK, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
- **Architecture**: ARM64 (aarch64)
- **Storage**: At least 1GB free space for SDK components
- **Network**: Active internet connection for package downloads

### User Permissions
- Administrative (sudo) access to the system
- User account with package installation privileges

### Verify System Compatibility
```bash
# Check Ubuntu version
lsb_release -a

# Verify architecture
uname -m

# Check available disk space
df -h
```

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Update System Packages

First, ensure your system is up-to-date:

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Add Qualcomm IoT Repository

The IM SDK packages are distributed through Qualcomm's official Ubuntu PPA (Personal Package Archive):

```bash
# Add the Qualcomm IoT PPA for Ubuntu Noble
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-qcom-iot/qcom-noble-ppa
```

**What this command does:**
- Adds Qualcomm's official package repository to your system
- Configures GPG keys for package verification
- Enables access to Qualcomm-specific software packages
- Targets Ubuntu Noble (24.04) release specifically

### Step 3: Update Package Lists

After adding the new repository, refresh your package lists:

```bash
# Update package lists to include new repository
sudo apt update
```

### Step 4: Install IM SDK Components

Install the core IM SDK packages:

```bash
# Install GStreamer sample applications and sensor test apps
sudo apt install -y gstreamer1.0-qcom-sample-apps qcom-sensors-test-apps
```

**Package Details:**

#### `gstreamer1.0-qcom-sample-apps`
- **Purpose**: Provides hardware-accelerated GStreamer plugins and sample applications
- **Features**: 
  - Video encoding/decoding using Qualcomm hardware
  - Camera capture and processing
  - Display output optimization
  - Multimedia pipeline examples
- **Size**: Approximately 150-200MB

#### `qcom-sensors-test-apps`
- **Purpose**: Testing and validation tools for device sensors
- **Features**:
  - Accelerometer testing
  - Gyroscope validation
  - Temperature sensor monitoring
  - GPIO interface testing
  - I2C/SPI communication tools
- **Size**: Approximately 50-100MB

## Testing the Installation

### Test GStreamer Functionality

```bash
# Test video pipeline
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! qcomvenc ! qcomvdec ! autovideosink

# Test camera capture (if camera is connected)
gst-launch-1.0 qcomcamsrc ! autovideosink
```
